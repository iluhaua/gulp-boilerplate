To start new project using this boilerplate:
1. clone repository
2. make a copy of cloned directory and remove .git folder(usually hidden) inside it

Then make sure you have nodejs installed, then do in that new directory

```
> sudo npm install -g gulp-cli
> sudo npm install -g gulp
> npm install
> gulp
```

You are ready to start.
